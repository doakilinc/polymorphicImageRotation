 *
 *     About: This file is used to read the given ppm file with the choosen
 *            method (row, col, or block); apply the choosen operations
 *            (rotations, flip, transpose, or time); and output the final image
 *            to the standard output. If the time operation is choosen, the 
 *            program prints out the necessary information to the timing file.
